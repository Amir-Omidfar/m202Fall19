## Project title : An indoor navigation for visually impaired people utilizing Ultra Wide Band Technology 

### Project Description: 
***Autonomous navigation is a crucial component for visually impaired people. Outdoors, positioning based on ubiquitous signals is feasible; however, for indoors, no universal positioning solution does exist. Due to the remarkably broad bandwidth, ultra-wideband (UWB) signs offer a proper multipath resolution and allow positioning with sub-meter (10 centimeter) accuracy. 
Also, because of the implementation of screen-reader software into mobile devices, visually impaired people start using smartphones. While creating a navigation system for the blind, this project focuses on adding sensors such as IMU, in wearable form, for increasing the accuracy of UWB modules. Finally, e-sense technology, implemented in earables, provides haptic feedback in guiding the visually impaired.***

## Objectives 
* Improve an indoor localization system with 3d mapping/visualization that uses UWB modules 
  1. Enhance the systems accuracy by using additional sensors (e.g IMU, â€¦ ). 
* Develop an application to utilize the UWB mapping platform in guiding visually impaired individuals
  1. Android app development
  2. E-Sense Earables to be implemented and utilized by the user through the app

## Methodology, Data Set and Experimental validation plan 
* Methodology:
  1. **The indoor localization section:** We will be building on an existing work mentioned in the related works section ([item #1](http://www.guoanhong.com/papers/SUI19-Minuet.pdf)) to improve the 3d mapping of current UWB modules for indoor localization. 
  2. **Earables and App development section:** An Android app would be used to interface between the mapping system and the user. Giving commands and feedbacks to the user using the microphone in earables  
* Experimental Validation: 
  1. Potential use of motion capture system for measuring the accuracy of our implemented UWB localization system. 
* Data Set:
  1.  Define a user study to collect data from visually impaired or blindfolded individuals to test out the system performance.

## Work split between the different team members :
1. **Riyya** :  Android application development for using Earables and getting feedback from Earables
2. **Amir** : UWB system setup, overall system integration
3. **Julian** :  UWB system setup, support on Android app development
