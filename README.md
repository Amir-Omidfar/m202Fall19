## Project title : An indoor navigation for visually impaired people utilizing Ultra Wide Band Technology 

### Project Description: 
***Autonomous navigation is a crucial component for visually impaired people. Outdoors, positioning based on ubiquitous signals is feasible; however, for indoors, no universal positioning solution does exist. Due to the remarkably broad bandwidth, ultra-wideband (UWB) signs offer a proper multipath resolution and allow positioning with sub-meter (10 centimeter) accuracy. 
Also, because of the implementation of screen-reader software into mobile devices, visually impaired people start using smartphones. While creating a navigation system for the blind, this project focuses on adding sensors such as IMU, in wearable form, for increasing the accuracy of UWB modules. Finally, e-sense technology, implemented in earables, provides haptic feedback in guiding the visually impaired.***
