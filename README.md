## Project title : An indoor navigation for visually impaired people utilizing Ultra Wide Band Technology 

### Project Description: 
***Autonomous navigation is a crucial component for visually impaired people. Outdoors, positioning based on ubiquitous signals is feasible; however, for indoors, no universal positioning solution does exist. Due to the remarkably broad bandwidth, ultra-wideband (UWB) signs offer a proper multipath resolution and allow positioning with sub-meter (10 centimeter) accuracy. 
Also, because of the implementation of screen-reader software into mobile devices, visually impaired people start using smartphones. While creating a navigation system for the blind, this project focuses on adding sensors such as IMU, in wearable form, for increasing the accuracy of UWB modules. Finally, e-sense technology, implemented in earables, provides haptic feedback in guiding the visually impaired.***

## Overall Goal: 
* Provide a voice command system to help blind people navigate in indoor locations 
### Specific aims: 
1. Implementation of an Ultra-wideband (UWB) real time localization system
2. Calculation of shortest path from userâ€™s location to destination
3. Android app with speech recognition and text to speech synthesis
4. Usage of bluetooth beacons to improve upon accuracy of the system
5. Integration of the three subsystems via communication protocols

## Methodology, Data Set and Experimental validation plan 
* Methodology:
  1. **The indoor localization section:** We will be building on an existing work mentioned in the related works section ([item #1](http://www.guoanhong.com/papers/SUI19-Minuet.pdf)) to improve the 3d mapping of current UWB modules for indoor localization. 
  2. **App development section:** An Android app would be used to interface between the mapping system and the user.  
  3. **MQTT Communication Protocol:** For receiving sensors data and setting up a CGI server for the purpose of the project.


## Work split between the different team members :
  1. **Riyya** :  Android application development 
  2. **Amir** : UWB system setup, overall system integration
  3. **Julian** :  Server setup, support on Android app development
